name: Run on Any Event

on:
  # This wildcard pattern will match any event
  # It includes all events like push, pull_request, issues, etc.
  # Optionally, you can use "on: push" or "on: [push, pull_request]" for specific events
  # For absolutely everything, use a workflow_dispatch or schedule to test
  # But below is how to match *any* event:
  workflow_dispatch:         # Allows manual triggering
  push:                      # Trigger on push
  pull_request:              # Trigger on PR
  issues:                    # Trigger on issue opened, edited, etc.
  issue_comment:             # Trigger on comments
  create:                    # Trigger on branch or tag creation
  delete:                    # Trigger on branch or tag deletion
  fork:                      # Trigger when someone forks
  release:                   # Trigger on releases
  pull_request_review:       # PR review
  pull_request_review_comment: # PR review comments
  watch:                     # Stars the repo
